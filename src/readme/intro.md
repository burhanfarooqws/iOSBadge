# iOSBadge - iOS style notification badges

iOSBadge is a small Javascript plugin that allows you to use iOS style notification badges on your icons or menu items in your website or web application.

## Big in features, tiny in file size

iOSBadge has lots methods, options, themes and sizes included by default. It is also really small in file size: the JS and CSS files combined are ~2kb minified and gzipped. There is no extra weight included since the plugin does not require jQuery, but you can link to jQuery inside your page and use iOSBadge like a regular jQuery plugin if you want to.
