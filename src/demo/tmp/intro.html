<h1 id="iosbadge-ios-style-notification-badges-for-modern-browsers">iOSBadge - iOS style notification badges for modern browsers</h1>
<p>iOSBadge is a small Javascript plugin that allows you to use iOS style notification badges on your icons or menu items in your website or web application.</p>
<h2 id="big-in-features-tiny-in-file-size">Big in features, tiny in file size</h2>
<p>iOSBadge has lots methods, options, themes and sizes included by default. It is also really small in file size: the JS and CSS files combined are ~2kb minified and gzipped. There is no extra weight included since the plugin does not require jQuery, but you can link to jQuery inside your page and use iOSBadge like a regular jQuery plugin if you want to.</p>
<h2 id="modern-components-for-modern-browsers">Modern components - for modern browsers</h2>
<p>iOSBadge is built using <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">Coffeescript</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>. Using Sass is important to have CSS math to generate all the different sized badges. The plugin uses CSS3 properties and works in modern browsers only, so no oldIE support is included.</p>
